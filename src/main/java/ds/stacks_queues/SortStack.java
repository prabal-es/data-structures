/**
 * 3.5 Sort Stack: Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use
 * an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure
 * (such as an array). The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
 * Hints: #15, #32, #43
 *
 * #15 3.5 One way of sorting an array is to iterate through the array and insert each element into
 *         a new array in sorted order. Can you do this with a stack?
 * #32 3.5 Imagine your secondary stack is sorted. Can you insert elements into it in sorted order?
 *         You might need some extra storage. What could you use for extra storage?
 * #43 3.5 Keep the secondary stack in sorted order, with the biggest elements on the top. Use the
 *         primary stack for additional storage.
