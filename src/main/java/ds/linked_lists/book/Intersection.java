     * SOLUTION
     * Let's draw a picture of intersecting linked lists to get a better feel for what is going on.
     * Here is a picture of intersecting linked lists:
     * And here is a picture of non-intersecting linked lists:
     * We should be careful here to not inadvertently draw a special case by making the linked lists the same
     * length.
     * Let's first ask how we would determine if two linked lists intersect.
     * Determining if there's an intersection.
     * How would we detect if two linked lists intersect? One approach would be to use a hash table and just
     * throw all the linked lists nodes into there. We would need to be careful to reference the linked lists by their
     * memory location, not by their value.
     * There's an easier way though. Observe that two intersecting linked lists will always have the same last node.
     * Therefore, we can just traverse to the end of each linked list and compare the last nodes.
     * How do we find where the intersection is, though?
     *
     * Finding the intersecting node.
     * One thought is that we could traverse backwards through each linked list. When the linked lists "split'; that's
     * the intersection. Of course, you can't really traverse backwards through a singly linked list.
     * If the linked lists were the same length, you could just traverse through them at the same time. When they
     * collide, that's your intersection.
     * When they're not the same length, we'd like to just "chop oW-or ignore-those excess (gray) nodes.
     * How can we do this? Well, if we know the lengths of the two linked lists, then the difference between those
     * two linked lists will tell us how much to chop off.
     * We can get the lengths at the same time as we get the tails of the linked lists (which we used in the first step
     * to determine if there's an intersection).
     *
     * Putting it all together.
     * We now have a multistep process.
     * 1. Run through each linked list to get the lengths and the tails.
     * 2. Compare the tails. If they are different (by reference, not by value), return immediately. There is no intersection.
     * 3. Set two pointers to the start of each linked list.
     * 4. On the longer linked list, advance its pointer by the difference in lengths.
     * 5. Now, traverse on each linked list until the pointers are the same.
     * The implementation for this is below.
     * 1 LinkedListNode findIntersection(LinkedListNode list1, LinkedListNode list2) {
     * 2 if (list1 == null I I list2 == nUll) return null;
     * 3
     * 4 /* Get tail and sizes.
     * 5 Result result1 getTailAndSize(list1);
     * 6 Result result2 = getTailAndSize(list2);
     * 7
     * 8 /* If different tail nodes, then there's no intersection.
     * 9 if (result1.tail != result2.tail) {
     * 10 return null;
     * 11 }
     * 12
     * 13 /* Set pointers to the start of each linked list.
     * 14 LinkedListNode shorter = result1.size < result2.size ? list1 : list2;
     * 15 LinkedListNode longer = result1.size < result2.size ? list2 : list1;
     * 16

     * 35 this.size = size;
     * 36 }
     * 37 }
     * 38
     * 39 Result getTailAndSize(LinkedListNode list) {
     * 40 if (list == nUll) return null;
     * 41
     * 42 int size = 1;
     * 43 LinkedListNode current = list;

     * 45 size++;
     * 46 current = current.next;
     * 47 }
     * 48 return new Result(current, size);

     * 54 cur rent = current.next;
     * 55 k--;
